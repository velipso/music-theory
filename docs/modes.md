Modes
=====

A mode is considered major if the 3rd scale degree is major (Lydian, Ionian, Mixolydian), and minor
if the 3rd scale degree is flat (Dorian, Aeolian, Phrygian, Locrian).

| Brightness | Mode            | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|------------|-----------------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Brightest  | Lydian          | - | - | - | # | - | - | - |
| .          | Ionian (Major)  | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| .          | Mixolydian      | - | - | - | - | - | - | b |
| .          | Dorian          | - | - | b | - | - | - | b |
| .          | Aeolian (Minor) | - | - | b | - | - | b | b |
| .          | Phrygian        | - | b | b | - | - | b | b |
| Darkest    | Locrian         | - | b | b | - | b | b | b |

Sharps and flats are relative to the Ionian (Major) mode.  For example, calculating the Dorian mode
of C starts by looking at C Major, then flattening the 3rd and 7th scale degrees (C D E F G A B
&rarr; C D Eb F G A Bb).

Locrian is rarely used because the I chord is diminished, which makes it very hard to associate it
with the tonal center.

Modes can also be thought of as using a different tonal center for the Major key.  For example, the
A minor scale has the same notes as C major, so it's like using C major except A is considered the
home.  This line of thinking is accurate, but not the best way to experience modes when practicing,
because the mind can get locked into hearing C as the tonal center.

It's better to focus on the differences between each mode and the Ionian mode, as this table is
based on, so that you notice the actual scale differences using the same home position.  This lets
the mind stay locked into a single tonal center, and feel the differences much easier.

Why is Ionian "Major" and Aeolian "Minor"?
------------------------------------------

Why are these two modes singled out?

I don't know, but if you look at them, the Ionian is the only mode that has a major chord for the
I, IV, and V, and the Aeolian is the only mode that has a minor chord for i, iv, and v.  I suspect
that's why.
