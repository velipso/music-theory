I think music-making must be a collection of skills.

It's overwhelming to think of what it takes to write a song, and when I attempt to write songs, I
feel frustrated that I can't go from an idea to reality.

In other areas of my life where I'm competent, I can draw on a large history of experience to know
when I'm veering off track.  But I don't have those same guardrails for music yet.

The idea of this page is to _decompose_ what it takes to go from idea to reality into a list of
individual skills.  Then I can practice the individual skills and slowly get better over time.

Hopefully, eventually, I can combine these skills into writing songs.  Until then, this will give me
some focus and make the journey feel less overhwhelming.
