Seconday Dominant
=================

Secondary Dominant is the Dominant (V chord) of a non-tonic scale degree.

| Scale Degree | Chord           | Secondary Dominant | Result      | Notes                     |
|:------------:|-----------------|--------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
|      1       | I               | V/I                | V7          | Normal chord within scale |
|      2       | ii              | V/ii               | VI7         | Common                    |
|      3       | iii             | V/iii              | VII7        | Not as common             |
|      4       | IV              | V/IV               | I7          | Common (identified by m7) |
|      5       | V               | V/V                | II7         | vi-V/V-V-I wind down      |
|      6       | vi              | V/vi               | III7        | Common                    |
|      7       | vii<sup>o</sup> | V/vii<sup>o</sup>  | #IV7        | Not used; out of scale    |

The Secondary Dominant is typically used before the chord it is derived from, because it resolves
strongly to that chord (because it is its Dominant).
